# Real-Time-Face-Detection-using-Matlab

Face detection is the process of identifying one or more human faces in images or
videos. It plays an important part in many biometric, security and surveillance
systems, as well as image and video indexing systems. This face detection using
MATLAB program can be used to detect a face, eyes and upper body on pressing
the corresponding buttons. This real-time face detection program is being
developed using MATLAB version R2019b. A graphic user interface (GUI)
allows users to perform tasks interactively through controls like switches and
sliders. You can easily create a GUI and run it in MATLAB or as a stand-alone
application. There are different types of algorithms used in face detection. Here,
we have used Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection using MATLAB program.
This algorithm works in following steps:
1. Creates a detector object using Viola-Jones algorithm
2. Takes the image from the video 
3. Detects features
4. Annotates the detected features
